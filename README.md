# Tree of Linked Lists Data Structure
A Java group project for Data Structures (CMPS303) course

This project implements a custom data structure - a Tree of Linked Lists - allowing users to perform basic operations such as insert, search, and delete through a Command Line Interface (CLI).

## Features

- **Tree of Linked Lists**: The core data structure comprising nodes, each holding a linked list.
- **Basic Operations**: Provides functionalities for insertion, searching, and deletion of elements.
- **CLI Interface**: Allows users to interact with the data structure through a simple command-line interface.

- ## Overview

The data structure is designed as a tree where each node contains a linked list. This structure enables efficient data storage and retrieval for various applications. The CLI interface is to test the basic operations in a setting where student data is stored using this structure
